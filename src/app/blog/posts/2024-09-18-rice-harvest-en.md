The rice harvest🌾 at POLE POLE rice field
has been completed ♩

It was so hot, so hot... 💦
It was a melting🫠 kind of day, but after finishing, we felt completely refreshed 🍃𓂃𓈒𓏸︎︎︎︎

While gazing at the cleanly harvested rice field,
I remembered a story my grandfather told me as a child
〜The origin of "Ine" (rice) comes from "Inochi no Ne" (roots of life)🤍〜

Reflecting anew on the importance of food...

Take it easy 👣
Live slowly 🍀➿
