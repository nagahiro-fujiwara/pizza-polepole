Framework completion means the completion of the frame
of pillars and beams, and installing the ridge beam
at the highest point of the roof.
It's also called "ridge raising" or "house raising" 🧐

Though it's a small single-story restaurant,
it's a natural, simple space filled with lots of love
from the master carpenter, architect, and restaurant family 🌳🤍

Starting from ground improvement, solid foundation work,
today exists upon everyone's supportive thoughts.
Thank you ✨

May construction continue safely from here 🍀
