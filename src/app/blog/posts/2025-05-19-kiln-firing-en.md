We completed the initial firing of our wood-fired kiln 🔥

The firing process is done to evaporate moisture contained in the kiln's clay material
and improve its durability.

We used hardwood that had been dried for over a year (moisture content 20% or less)
and burned for about 8 hours per day,
gradually increasing the temperature step by step:
Day 1: 100℃ → Day 2: 175℃ → Day 3: 250℃ → Day 4 onwards: 250℃~

Since it was handmade, we were extremely nervous
about whether it would function properly as a wood-fired kiln...
But both combustion and smoke exhaust worked without problems,
and the kiln temperature rose smoothly.

This is thanks to everyone involved in kiln construction, chimney installation, firewood procurement
who gave us their wisdom and strength,
and everyone who supports us.
Thank you 🌿

From now on, with this adorable alter ego,
we will continue preparing for opening while repeatedly testing
so we can bake gentle and delicious pizza.
This is where the real challenge begins ✴︎

Please wait a little longer 🙏😅

*Supervisor, thank you for the ash bucket. It's wonderful ✨
