Raindrops
Droplets
Gentle rain

There are various ways to call them ðŸ’§

Even small drops like raindrops
can bore holes in rocks over a long time...

Spring rain is also called catalyst rain,
encouraging various flowers to bloom ðŸŒ±

May the road rise to meet you.
May the wind be always at your back.
May the sun shine warm upon your face.
And rains fall soft upon your fields.
And until we meet again,
May God hold you in the hollow of His hand.

Take it easy ðŸ‘£
Live slowly ðŸŒ¸âž¿
