From our opening on 6/26 until today
Time has flown by in the blink of an eye 💨
Thank you to everyone who has visited us.
To those we couldn't accommodate due to full capacity, sold-out dough, etc.
We sincerely apologize.

Our restaurant has limited seating, and we can only bake
2 pizzas at a time.
However...
We are supported by everyone who makes the special trip
to visit POLE POLE, and who patiently waits for us,
wrapping us in their warmth even during long wait times.
Thank you. We are truly happy 🌿

From now on, we will continue to
prepare with all our heart
bake with all our might 🔥
serve with all our might 🧑🏻‍🦰
Please continue to support us.

After the beginning of autumn
Rice ears have appeared in the POLE POLE rice field next door.
Even in this scorching summer, the seasons are definitely progressing 🌾

Though summer is almost over, we hope everyone's summer
will be filled with joy and many happy moments 𓂃 𓈒𓏸◌

Let's take it easy 🩴
Live slowly 👒
