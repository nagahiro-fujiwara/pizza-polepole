## Tanabata - Star Festival 🎋

More than 10 days since our opening...
We are grateful to the many people
who support us and have visited us 𓂃 𓈒𓏸◌‬

POLE POLE is a Swahili message meaning
"take it easy, step by step"
We want you to step away from your busy daily life,
listen to the crackling sound of firewood,
be healed by the greenery visible from our windows,
and spend spiritually rich moments here.
Such feelings are embedded in this place.

May our loved ones be happy
May our loved ones always smile 🌳ˊ˗

Let's take it easy, POLE POLE 👣

Take it easy 🎋
Live slowly 🐢➿
