A Small Encounter 🍀

Just before noon today,
as I was leaving the store to go home
after attending a plastering work meeting...
I saw a foreign girl across the street
who had gotten off her bicycle and was standing with her smartphone in hand.

I wondered what was wrong and went to see,
and she gestured for me to look at her smartphone screen 👀ˊ˗

Both my wife and I, who are not good at English, were nervous 😱💭
When we looked at the screen she showed us,
Wood-fired PIZZA POLE POLE was on Google map!

✓ I want to go here📍
✓ Are you the shop owner?
✓ When will you open?
✓ Are you open every day?

She asked these questions in rapid succession in English...

Both of us covered up our nervousness with big smiles
and tried to communicate with the words we could think of and gestures.
I wonder if we got through to her?

Thank you 🌿
For going out of your way to look for our store 🚲ꔛ

May we become a store loved by people from all over the world even before opening.

Take it easy 👣
Live slowly 🍀
