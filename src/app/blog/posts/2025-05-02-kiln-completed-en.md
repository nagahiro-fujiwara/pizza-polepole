Wood-Fired Kiln Completed ✴︎

The wood-fired kiln construction that started at the end of March
has finally finished
after going through various processes 🌿

The exceptional sense of achievement and attachment
from making it ourselves
is beyond imagination.

The finish is white sand plaster ⬜️

After drying,
we will slowly conduct the firing process for one week starting next week
to create a strong and gentle kiln 🔥

We are happily progressing with opening preparations
while envisioning people becoming happy with POLE POLE pizza 💚

Please wait a little longer
until opening.
We are working diligently 😅💪🏻 ̖́-

Live slowly 🐢➿
