Today, June 26th, 2025.
Our restaurant "Wood-Fired Pizza POLE POLE" has successfully opened in Saijo, Higashihiroshima City.

"POLE POLE" means "take it easy" in Swahili.
In our busy daily lives, we want you to pause and enjoy a peaceful moment.
We created this restaurant with that feeling in mind.

The star is our hot pizza baked in a wood-fired oven.
Using fresh local ingredients, we carefully prepare each dough from scratch.
Pizza enjoyed with all five senses, along with the crackling sounds and aroma of burning wood, is surely exceptional.

In our warm wooden space where light streams through the windows,
why not come to slowly and peacefully satisfy your stomach and heart?

We hope to become a place that brings small happiness to your daily life.

Please take care of us for years to come.

We look forward to meeting you all from the bottom of our hearts.
