August brings many events such as
participating in community activities, ancestral memorials, and family gatherings,
so we will be closed as noted above.

From everyone who looks forward to POLE POLE's pizza,
we hear "How many days are you taking off?! 😤" but...

Just like our customers, we have things we value:
continuing to be part of our community,
remembering that we exist thanks to our ancestors,
not forgetting the importance of family bonds...
and more 𓂃 𓈒𓏸◌

We will continue to
prepare with care
and bake with all our heart 🔥

We look forward to your visit 🌻

Like the refreshing summer sky,
may your hearts be bright and cheerful ✨
