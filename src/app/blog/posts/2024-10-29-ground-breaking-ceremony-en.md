A Special Day ~ Ground-Breaking Ceremony ~ 🌳

Today we held our ground-breaking ceremony

The ceremony is a ritual to ask permission from the land's guardian spirits
to use the land, praying for:
✓ Construction safety
✓ Prosperity of the restaurant, customers, and family

It was conducted sacredly by a priest from
Aki-Saijo Shingu Shrine ⛩️

It has been 1 year and 4 months to reach this point, with various challenges
But thanks to the support from our local community,

and all the people surrounding us,
we were able to reach this starting line
Thank you so much!
