## 2024.11.11(mon)〜12.18(wed)

The foundation construction for our restaurant has been successfully completed

All construction work for this year is now finished
The next 4 weeks will be a curing period ☕️⸝⸝⸝

Thanks to young, skilled technicians,
battle-tested veteran craftsmen, site supervisors, and master carpenters
who each brought uncompromising
construction and management in their specialized fields,
a strong and beautiful foundation has been completed
Thank you very much 🩶

In the new year, after the pine decorations are removed
and the New Year deities return home,
the framework completion ceremony will finally begin♩

We hope construction continues safely 🌳ˊ˗

Take it easy 👣
Live slowly 🎅🏻➿
