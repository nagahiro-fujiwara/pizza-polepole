We went to Narashino City, Chiba Prefecture
to learn wood-fired kiln making 🔥ˊ˗

When opening a wood-fired pizza restaurant,
one of the things we couldn't compromise on was
"I want to build the kiln myself!" 🌿

But while searching for how to do it...

We encountered a beloved pizzeria
and connected with Freehand Co., Ltd.,
which led to this wonderful opportunity 🪢

Using actual kits,
learning more concretely
by doing it ourselves and remembering the feel,
it became an experience beyond imagination.
Also, they taught us cheerfully about
what to keep in mind and how to deal with cases
where things don't go according to the blueprints,
including failure examples.

"Make both kiln building and restaurant management enjoyable!"
they encouraged us,
and we received lots of courage along with the techniques ✴︎

Thank you ⭐️

It was great that we went 🍀

Take it easy 👣
Live slowly 🪢➿
