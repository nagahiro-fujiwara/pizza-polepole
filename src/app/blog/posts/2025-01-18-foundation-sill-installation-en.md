Foundation Sill Installation

In this morning's cold with Higashihiroshima's minimum temperature of -5.2°C,
the "foundation sill installation" was completed as a preliminary process
for the framework completion on the 20th 🔨

"Foundation sill installation" is
the work of placing the foundation sills on top of the concrete foundation.
The sill installation and subsequent structural parts
form the backbone of the building—a very important process 🖋️

We've cleared challenges one by one to reach this point.
Finally, the framework completion ceremony is next Monday.
I feel both excitement and a sense of focused determination.
