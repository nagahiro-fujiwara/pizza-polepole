Making Progress 👣

Thank you for watching our kiln-making process
through our daily stories 🌿

While we have been concentrating on kiln construction,
woodwork, plastering, equipment installation, and other work
are entering their final stages.

Starting from our desire to make POLE POLE
a place where the joy of eating and the happiness of living
are born from sharing meals with family, colleagues, community members, and others...
The natural, simple space that the master carpenter, architect, and owner family
have poured so much love into
is being brought to reality through masterful craftsmanship 𖥔

Because there are unknown factors such as
the building completion schedule and kiln operation status after completion,
we cannot clearly decide on the opening date,
but please wait with your generous hearts 🤍
We will announce it as soon as it's decided ꉂ📢

PS: Now that our address is decided, we've added
a Google link to our Instagram top page 🌏
Please take a look 👀

Take it easy 👣
Live slowly 🐢➿
