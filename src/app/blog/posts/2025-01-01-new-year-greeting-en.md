## 2025.New Year's Day

Happy New Year✴︎

About two years since retirement, preparing for opening
"Are you really going to do it?" "Plans falling through?" "How are you?"...
I've probably caused much worry
for everyone who's been supporting me 😵‍💫💦

Starting a business in one's late 50s is no ordinary task
Maintaining and strengthening physical stamina is also a major challenge
But...
With "pole pole" as our motto, gently, long-lasting, and joyfully
I hope to create a place where everyone who comes
can become gentle 🍕

I still believe it's worth living🤍

May everyone's new year
be filled with smiles ✨

May the wind always
push you forward from behind 🍃𓂃𓈒𓏸︎︎︎︎
