## The Warmth of Wood-Fired Oven ðŸ”¥

Today we're introducing the heart of our restaurant, our **wood-fired oven**.

Pizza baked quickly at temperatures exceeding 400Â°C.
The crackling sound of burning wood,
The rising aroma of smoke,
And the careful finishing of each pizza by our craftsmen.

Just watching the flames dance in the oven
Creates a mysteriously calming time.

Slowly, little by little.
Enjoy the POLE POLE experience.

Please come and taste the pizza
baked in this wood-fired ovenâœ¨
