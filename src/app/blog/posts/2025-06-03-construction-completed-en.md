Construction work has been safely completed
and we received the handover 👀

It's been 2 years since we formed a connection
with Sanshigoya & Kurashi no Tane Co., Ltd.
The 7-month construction process since
last year's groundbreaking ceremony on 10/29
went by in a flash,
but it was a very happy time 🍀

Building construction is just a means,
and the master carpenter and supervisor's values and thoughts about their work—
imagining customers gathering in this building feeling relieved,
wanting to support store operators by providing a space where they can peacefully welcome customers while enjoying their own lives—
were truly wonderful and something to be grateful for 🥹

Also,
the craftsmen who took pride in their work
and infused their mastery into every process
were really amazing ✨

Thanks to everyone, construction proceeded safely without injuries ✴︎

Thank you. We are grateful 🥲

Take it easy 🐢➿
Live slowly ☕️
