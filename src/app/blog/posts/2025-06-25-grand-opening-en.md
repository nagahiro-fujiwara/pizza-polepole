## We Open Tomorrow, Thursday June 26th at 11:00 AM 🙃

This is all thanks to everyone's support.
Thank you 🤍

We are a small restaurant with 14 seats, 5 parking spaces, 2 staff members, homemade drinks,
and a handmade wood-fired kiln where we bake each pizza one by one.
You may have to wait, we may not be able to accommodate your requests perfectly,
and we may run out of pizza dough,
but we hope you'll embrace us with your generous hearts
and visit us at your own pace.

While our restaurant specializes in the limited genre of pizza,
we focus on ingredient selection that considers
the deliciousness of seasonal ingredients and food safety,
hoping to become a place that creates
◎ The joy of eating ◎ The joy of living
that comes from sharing meals with family, colleagues, community members, and others 🌿

We will bake with all our heart 🔥
We will serve you with all our heart 🧑🏻‍🦰

We look forward to your visit.
Please note that we do not offer takeout.

Take it easy 👣
Live slowly 🐢➿
