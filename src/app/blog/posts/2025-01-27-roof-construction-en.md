What is Galvalume steel sheet? ✍🏻〰️
It's a metal steel sheet coated with
aluminum, zinc, and silicon plating,
sometimes called aluminum-zinc alloy plated steel sheet 🧐

A father-and-son eagle🦅 roofing team
completed the work carefully and beautifully ✨
In these times when few young people inherit family trades,
from grandfather to father, and now the third generation—
the 22-year-old takes pride in his work 👀ˊ˗

Various people's efforts come together gradually
to build the structure 🌿

I hope this space, filled with everyone's energy,
becomes a healing place where people can enjoy
pizza that's gentle on both body and soul ☺︎

May the road always be before you🍀

Take it easy 👣
