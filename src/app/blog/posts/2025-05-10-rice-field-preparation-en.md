Rice field preparation 🚜➿

While store construction progresses,
we completed rice field preparation for the POLE POLE rice field.

Around our restaurant, adjacent to rice fields, mountains, and rivers,
wild flowers, wild grasses, small animals, and insects also live 🐞

Precisely because we live in an era where
convenient and comfortable living environments are taken for granted,
we want to cherish the heart that appreciates nature 💚

Take it easy 👣
Live slowly 🐌➿
