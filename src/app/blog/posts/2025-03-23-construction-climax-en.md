It's a warm day with temperatures exceeding 20°C 🔅

Wild flowers are beginning to bloom on the POLE POLE embankment too,
and we can hear the croaking of frogs ♩

Store construction is reaching its climax,
and even today, Sunday, the master carpenter is silently working 🔨
The prefectural road in front of the store has little traffic on this holiday,
and when we open the windows, a pleasant breeze flows through 🌿

Every year at this time,
memories of indescribable feelings
of farewells and new encounters come back to me

Just a little more until opening.
We are preparing while looking forward to
meeting all of you 👣

May your farewells and new encounters
become spices that add
rich colors to your future life ✨

Take it easy 🌸
Live slowly ☕️➿
