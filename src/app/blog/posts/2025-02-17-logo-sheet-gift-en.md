Sanshigoya & Kurashi no Tane Co., Ltd.
presented us with a LOGO sheet
Thank you 🌿

Maybe this will give some hint to people
who were wondering "What are they building there?"...

🖌️〰️〰️
The LOGO design is
an eraser stamp made by our daughter 👀ˊ˗
Thank you 💚

This week we have another cold wave coming 😳
Everyone please stay safe 🍀

Take it easy 👣
Live slowly ☃️➿
