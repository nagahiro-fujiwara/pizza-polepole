Last weekend
we finished planting rice in the POLE POLE rice field.

This morning, when I went to check the rice field,
I found Triops 👀　(3rd photo)
Triops have maintained the same appearance for over 200 million years
and help by eating weed sprouts and stirring the water as they move around,
sending oxygen to the rice roots 🥺

With gratitude for this ancient life force,
we hope they will grow healthy and strong 🌾
