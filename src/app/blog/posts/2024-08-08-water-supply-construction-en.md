## 2024.08.08(thu)〜08.09(fri)

Water supply connection work has been completed 🚧
We encountered a sudden torrential downpour🌩️ along the way,
but thankfully it ended without any injuries or accidents 😮‍💨
Thank you to everyone involved

Starting in September, ground improvement work begins
and we're finally moving toward building construction...🔨🌳

Independent business ownership presents various challenges,
but I want to always keep my feelings fresh
and maintain a spirited mood... 𓂃 𓈒𓏸◌

Take it easy 👣
Live slowly 🐢➿
