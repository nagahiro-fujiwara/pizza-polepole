September brings community events and rice harvesting,
so we will be closed as noted above for autumn activities.

Though we've passed Shosho (End of Heat)...
it's still very hot 🫠

The kitchen is also a scorching space thanks to the wood-fired oven 😂
but when you eat our hot, fresh pizza and smile,
it blows away our heat too 💨

At POLE POLE, we prepare
hot pizza baked in our wood-fired oven and a peaceful space,
and we sincerely look forward to your visit 𓂃 𓈒𓏸◌

Whether you come alone or with someone special,
so you can spend a comfortable time,
we will prepare with care
bake with all our heart 🔥
serve with all our might 🧑🏻‍🦰

Let's take it easy 🌾
Live slowly 🌿
