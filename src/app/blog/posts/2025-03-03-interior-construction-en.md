Interior construction is progressing ðŸªšðŸªœ

The silent, uncompromising construction process
is very inspiring to watch âœ¨

"If you don't do the unseen parts properly, the finish won't be beautiful..."
says the solitary master carpenter.

But during breaks, the master carpenter
also has a side that likes chocolate and rice crackers ðŸ¤­â™¡

Take it easy ðŸ‘£
Live slowly ðŸŽŽâž¿
