Framework Completion Aerial Photography 🚁

Drone footage of the framework completion ceremony 👀❕

The supervising first-class architect and site supervisor
captured yesterday's framework completion with drone aerial photography 😍
Of course, with proper licenses and flight filming permits
obtained from relevant authorities for professional shooting 📹

Starting with spectacular footage from above the crane,
✓ Panoramic views of the entire building and site
✓ Commemorative shots of the master carpenter and myself at the framework completion
✓ Rural landscape views - enjoy them from the sky too 🌏ˊ˗

Take it easy 👣
Live slowly 🚁‪➿
