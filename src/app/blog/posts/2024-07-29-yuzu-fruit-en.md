The yuzu tree at the shop owner's home bore a single fruit
It's still green and small

The main flower language of yuzu is "healthy beauty,"
but it also carries meanings of "happiness" and "joyful news" 🍀

Like this fruit that worked hard to grow,
we want to move forward joyfully
while preparing our bodies and minds
so we can share the happy news of our opening♩

Take it easy 👣
Live slowly 🍋➿
