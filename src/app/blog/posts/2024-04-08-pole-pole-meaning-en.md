# 🍕Our Thoughts Behind the Name "POLE POLE" ✍🏻〰️

"POLE POLE" /pole-pole/
"Take it easy" "Live slowly"　

𓐄𓐄𓐄𓐄𓐄𓐄𓐄𓐄𓐄𓐄𓐄𓐄𓐄𓐄𓐄𓐄𓐄𓐄𓐄𓐄𓐄𓐄𓐄𓐄𓐄𓐄𓐄𓐄𓐄𓐄𓐄𓐄𓐄𓐄𓐄𓐄𓐄𓐄𓐄𓐄𓐄𓐄𓐄𓐄𓐄𓐄𓐄𓐄𓐄𓐄𓐄𓐄𓐄𓐄

In our rapidly changing
and uncertain modern world,
our hectic daily lives
sacrifice precious time
for various reasons.

Perhaps
we unconsciously choose
such an environment ourselves...

In such daily life,
while we wish for courage to change
what we want to change,
sometimes we also need courage
to accept what cannot be changed.
But which courage should we have...
 
In such moments, entrusting ourselves to the sound of "pole pole"
and taking time to listen to the voice of our hearts
might be just what we need.

We hope to become such a place 🌳ˊ˗

May the road always be before you
May the wind always be at your back 🍀

Let's take it easy ♩
pole pole ☺︎
