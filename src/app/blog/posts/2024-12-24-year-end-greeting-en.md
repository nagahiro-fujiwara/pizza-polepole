## 2024.12.24(tue)

Just over a week left in this year...
What kind of year was it for everyone? 👀ˊ˗

For us, it was a year of courage
And...
Everyone's cheers were so encouraging
and became our energy to keep going this year 🔥

The new year 2025/Reiwa 7/Year of the Snake is said to be
"a year of accumulating efforts and stabilizing things"
With flexible hearts and wisdom,
we want to face new challenges 💪🏻 ̖́-
