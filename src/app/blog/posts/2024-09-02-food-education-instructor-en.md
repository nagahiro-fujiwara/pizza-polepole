## Obtained NPO Japan Food Education Instructor Primary Qualification ✍🏻ˊ˗

One of the reasons we wanted to
≪ open a wood-fired pizza restaurant ≫
is "the importance of food" 🍽💭

We are working hard to create a restaurant where people can eat
"gentle pizza" that satisfies both body and soul.
We wanted to view food from a broader perspective and properly acquire food education knowledge,
so we challenged ourselves to obtain this qualification.

## Changes in Japanese Dietary Culture

Japanese dietary culture has changed:

**▽Around 1945, shortly after the war**
The era of poor eating, when many people struggled to find food for today and tomorrow

**▽From the 1960s high economic growth period**
An era of mass production and mass consumption

**▽From around the 1980s**
An era of food abundance

**▽And now in modern times**
An era of "lost eating" where we have forgotten the purpose and meaning of food

While we live in a very rich and convenient society today,
problems have begun to emerge such as:
▲Decreased opportunities for families to gather around the dining table
▲Elderly people eating alone
▲Malnutrition, etc.

## Our Wish

Although we are a restaurant specializing in the limited genre of pizza,
we hope to become a place that creates:

◎ The joy of eating
◎ The joy of living

Through selecting ingredients that focus on the deliciousness of seasonal ingredients and food safety,
and through sharing meals with family, colleagues, community members, and others.

May our loved ones be happy
May our loved ones always smile 🌳ˊ˗

Take it easy 👣
Live slowly 🐢➿
