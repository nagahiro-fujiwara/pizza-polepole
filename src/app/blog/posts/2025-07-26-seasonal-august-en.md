Announcing our August "Seasonal Pizza"! 📢

But first...
Today marks one month since our opening! 🌻
We've welcomed so many customers,
filled with heartwarming reunions and wonderful new encounters.
It's been a truly joyful month. Thank you! 🤍

However, we've also had times when we kept you waiting,
couldn't accommodate your preferences as hoped,
or ran out of dough,
and we sincerely apologize to all who looked forward to visiting us.

We will continue to
serve you with all our heart and bake with all our passion! 🔥
We hope you'll continue visiting us despite these challenges! 😅

## August Seasonal Pizza

"Summer Vegetable and Homemade Pancetta Tomato Cream Pizza"

### Features

On a mozzarella cheese base,
we top with okra, zucchini, edamame, and homemade pancetta,
finished with tomato sauce & fresh cream and Parmigiano
to gently bring out the umami of summer vegetables.

Seasonal ingredients contain the richest nutrients of their season.
How about a gentle pizza for bodies tired from the summer heat? 𓂃 𓈒𓏸◌

Have a wonderful summer!
Enjoy Life ⛱️
